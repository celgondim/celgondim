### *Let me tell you how I became a developer.*
> 10+ years of experience in the financial market and in 2020, while preparing for a selection process for the Audit area, I learned my first programming language, python, and I simply fell in love with it.
>
> This was the beginning of my career transition into the tech world. In 2021, I intensified my studies with bootcamps, started my postgraduate degree in technology, innovation and intelligence and participated in my first SAP ABAP academy only for women by *Accenture Brazil.*
>
> Last year, in 2022, I was hired as an ABAP software developer by *Accenture Brazil* and I am currently part of the OTC team for the Aurora project, which brings the largest global digital transformation of back office / ERP solutions and the largest SAP S/4 HANA implementation in the world.

> âœ¨ _**I love learning new things, finding practical solutions to problems and facilitating processes.**_
